    \cvitem{LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)}{2019-present}{
        Leading the high-redshift cosmology analysis using Lyman-break Galaxies (LBGs), including measurements of the UV Luminosity Function, clustering, and cross-correlations with CMB lensing.
        Also developing the photometric redshift pipeline for DESC cosmology.

    \cvitem{The Vera C. Rubin Observatory}{2021-present}{
        Developing and commissioning the active optics system, including leading development of wavefront estimation algorithms, using analytic, forward modeling, and deep learning methods.
        Member of the photometric redshift (photo-z) commissioning team and the observing support team.

    \cvitem{Duke University Neutrino and Cosmology Group}{2016-2019}{
        Simulated core-collapse supernova neutrino bursts.
        Quantified sensitivity and developed Bayesian analysis methods for the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) neutrino detector.
    }

    \cvitem{Karlsruhe Institute of Technology}{2018}{
        Studied muon content of cosmic rays detected with the IceTop Array and developed deep learning methods for data analysis (advised by Andreas Haungs).
