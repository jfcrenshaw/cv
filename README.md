# cv

Repo for my cv.

Synced with overleaf.

PDF built with github action, and served on github pages at <https://jfcrenshaw.github.io/cv/cv.pdf>

The publication list and associated metrics are pulled from ADS and automatically formatted using `script/build_cv_pubs.py`.
To run this script you need to have the [ADS Python module](https://github.com/andycasey/ads/) installed in your environment and you must save your ADS API token in `~/.ads/dev_key`.
